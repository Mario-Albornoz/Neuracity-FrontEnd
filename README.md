This is the front end and backend for Sch√ºlerly's proof of concept, for now it is meant to run locally with node.js as the backend

AI-powered education management platform for school teachers that automates content creation, assignments, curriculum alignment, and analytics to enhance teaching efficiency. In the future we will implement a protocol called multi model verification pipeline to verify the validity and accuracy of the generated material.

## How to run
This repo uses Reat + Vite, and Node.js for the backend. 

## Install 

Tailwind Css for styling
recharts for graphics and charts.
@mui/icons-material
@emotion/react @emotion/styled (if it doesn't work with these two, check the error message and install the dependency it asks for)

For the Backend you should install:
Node.js (in your system)
cors
express

Run npm run dev, to start running it locally.
