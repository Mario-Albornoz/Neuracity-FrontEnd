This is the front end for Sch√ºlerly's prototype, for now it is meant to run locally

AI-powered education management platform for school teachers that automates content creation, assignments, curriculum alignment, and analytics to enhance teaching efficiency. In the future we will implement a protocol called multi model verification pipeline to verify the validity and accuracy of the generated material.

## How to run
This repo uses Reat + Vite,

Install Tailwind Css for styling

Install recharts for graphics and charts.

Run npm install @mui/icons-material
Run npm i @emotion/react @emotion/styled (if it doesn't work with these two, check the error message and install the dependency it asks for)

Run npm run dev, to start running it locally.
